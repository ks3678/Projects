## ArabianKnight: 
Worked with a group of 3 to create a 2D top-down game in MonoGame using Visual Studio and C#. The game shares unique handcrafted textures and a level editor was created to allow for easier development of levels.Taking place in the middle-east, ArabianKnight focuses on eliminating obstacles in order to achieve the goal of assassinating the crime boss. I personally developed the main character, including its controls, abilities, GUI, and attack detection, allowing players to experience a smooth gameplay while exploring different strategies to complete the level.

## Asteroid
A score based game created using Unity that challenges players to dodge and destroy asteroids. Developed with a self-coded collision detection and incorporates authentic like physics to produce an intriguing gameplay experience.

## Vayne CrossBow
Created a simple replica of League of Legends Vayne in-game crossbow through Maya. The 3D model comes with it's own UV Map, ambient occlusion, and normal map.<br>
